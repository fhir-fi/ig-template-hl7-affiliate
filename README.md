# ig-template-hl7-affiliate
Base IG template to be used as a base for IGs published by HL7 Affiliates.
Based on [fhir.base.template](https://github.com/HL7/ig-template-base).
Adopts the colors from the main FHIR specification mimicking the
[hl7.fhir.template](https://github.com/HL7/ig-template-fhir) that derives from the 
[hl7.base.template](https://github.com/HL7/ig-template-hl7). 

Package id: `hl7.affiliate.template`

You can use it directly by stating 

`template = https://github.com/fhir-fi/ig-template-hl7-affiliate#current`

but you should probably derive your own template based on this base template.
